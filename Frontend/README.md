## 🛣️ Routing

The application uses React Router DOM for client-side routing:

- `/` - Landing page
- `/role/tourist/*` - Tourist portal (public)
- `/role/vendor/*` - Vendor portal (protected)
- `/role/guide/*` - Guide portal (protected)
- `/role/hotel-owner/*` - Hotel portal (protected)
- `/role/government/*` - Admin portal (protected)

## 🎯 Component Architecture

### Layout Components
Each role portal has its own layout component:
- `VendorLayout` - Vendor sidebar and topbar
- `GuideLayout` - Guide sidebar and navigation
- `ProviderLayout` - Hotel owner layout
- `Layout` - Government admin layout

### Protected Routes
Role-specific protected route components ensure authentication:
- `ProtectedRoute` - Vendor authentication
- `GuideProtectedRoute` - Guide authentication
- `HotelProtectedRoute` - Hotel owner authentication
- `GovProtectedRoute` - Government admin authentication

## 🎨 Styling

The project uses **Tailwind CSS 4** for styling:
- Utility-first approach
- Responsive design with mobile-first breakpoints
- Custom color schemes per role portal
- Consistent spacing and typography

### Custom Styles
- Landing page specific styles in `MainLanding/styles/`
- Sidebar scroll styles
- Event and product scroll animations
- Rainbow border effects

## 🔌 API Integration

The frontend communicates with the backend API using Axios:
- Base URL configured for API calls
- JWT tokens stored in localStorage
- Automatic token injection in request headers
- Error handling for API responses

## 🧩 Global Components

### ChatbotButton
Floating chatbot button accessible throughout the application for tourist assistance.

### EmergencyWidget
Emergency support widget providing quick access to help and emergency services.

## 📱 Responsive Design

The application is fully responsive with breakpoints:
- Mobile: 375px+
- Tablet: 768px+
- Desktop: 1024px+
- Large Desktop: 1280px+

## 🚀 Performance Optimizations

- Code splitting with React Router
- Lazy loading for heavy components
- Image optimization with proper formats (AVIF, WebP)
- Efficient re-renders with React hooks
- Tailwind JIT compilation for minimal CSS

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port already in use**: Change port in `vite.config.js` or kill the process using the port
2. **API connection errors**: Verify backend is running and CORS is configured
3. **Build errors**: Clear `node_modules` and reinstall dependencies
4. **Tailwind styles not applying**: Ensure Tailwind is properly imported in `index.css`

## 📝 Notes

- The application uses React 19 features
- All routes are client-side rendered
- Authentication state is managed via React Context
- JWT tokens are stored in localStorage
- Images are optimized and served from the `public` directory
